## Key Components

*   **`app/index.tsx`:** The main entry point of the Expo app. It handles the game's logic, state management, and UI rendering.
*   **`components/EmailsList.tsx`:** This component is responsible for displaying the list of emails and handling user interactions with them.
*   **`components/TagsList.tsx`:** This component allows users to select the difficulty level of the game.
*   **`server.py`:** The Python backend server that generates phishing emails and serves them to the Expo app.
*   **`model.py`:** Contains the logic for sampling and generating email content.
*   **`generated_phishing_emails.json`:** A JSON file containing a collection of pre-generated phishing emails.

## Customization

*   **Adding/Modifying Emails:** You can add or modify emails in the `generated_phishing_emails.json` file. Ensure the JSON structure is maintained.
*   **Styling:** Customize the app's appearance by modifying the styles in the `StyleSheet.create` blocks within the component files.
*   **Sound Effects:** Replace the sound files in the `assets/sounds/` directory to change the game's audio.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** Adjust the game's difficulty levels by modifying the logic in `TagsList.tsx` and the email generation in `server.py`.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"npm start" fails:**
    *   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed correctly.
    *   Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.
*   **App crashes on device/emulator:**
    *   Check the Expo DevTools for error messages.
    *   Ensure your device/emulator is connected to the internet.
    *   Try restarting the Expo development server.
*   **Backend server errors:**
    *   Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
    *   Check the terminal output for error messages.
