Using the following inspiration data, generate a phishing email with a subject, greeting, body, 
and a call-to-action that includes a link. The email should be under 200 words.

--- Inspiration Data ---
Phishing Email Example:
Email Text: "{sample_email_text}"
Email Type: "{sample_email_type}"

Phishing URL Data:
URL: "{sample_url}"
Domain: "{sample_domain}"

Phishtank Data:
Target (Company/Brand): "{sample_target}"

--- Email Difficulty Instructions ---
Difficulty Level: "{difficulty}"
Instructions:
- For "phishnoob": Generate an email with very obvious mistakes and red flags (e.g., poor grammar, 
  misspellings, and clumsily formatted links).
- For "phishmediate": Generate an email that is moderately deceptive. It should appear realistic 
  but include some subtle cues indicating itâ€™s a phishing attempt.
- For "phishmaster": Generate a highly convincing email that closely mimics legitimate communications, 
  with only the slightest hints that it is a phishing attempt.

Please generate the phishing email now.
